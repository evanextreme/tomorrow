The daily planning app Tomorrow

Project Horizon is intended to be a cross platform daily planner application that is built from the ground up for simplicity. Instead of thinking about your life far in the future, take a few steps back, and think about only the day ahead of you. Horizon is a to-do list application infused with many other features that just make sense, such as weather functionality and an alarm clock. Once you wake up the next day, the app will transform itself into the tasks you need to perform today. Once you complete those tasks, the app will transform back into the planning stage.
