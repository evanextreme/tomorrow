The daily planning app Tomorrow

Tomorrow is intended to be a cross platform daily planner application that is built from the ground up for simplicity. Instead of thinking about your life far in the future, take a few steps back, and think about only the day ahead of you. Tomorrow is a to-do list application infused with many other features that just make sense, such as a useful guide with weather and day information to help you plan the day ahead of you, and on some devices automatic notification reminders throughout the day to make sure you get your stuff done. Instead of focusing on when, focus on how. Plan for Tomorrow.
